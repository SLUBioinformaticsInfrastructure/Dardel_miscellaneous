# Scratch

Your home directory on Dardel is capped at 25 GB. 

PDS's scratch however, has no cap and can be used for temporary large files. All data gets automatically removed after 30 days. 

```{.bash}
cd $PDC_TMP
```

## Conda, singularity and apptainer and scratch

To prevent conda, singularity or apptainer to use up precious storage in your home directory, you can set their package directories/ cache directories to scratch. 

In you home directory, open the hidden file `.bashrc`. Add, save and re-start the ssh connection: 

```{.bash}
export CONDA_PKGS_DIRS=$PDC_TMP/conda/packages
export SINGULARITY_CACHE=$PDC_TMP/singularity/cache
export APPTAINER_CACHE=$PDC_TMP/apptainer/cache
```

# Home directory
